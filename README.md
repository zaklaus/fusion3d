Fusion3D
==

Simple 3D Game Engine with dynamic shading, physics and reflected modular programming.

##Build Dependencies##
- [CMAKE](http://www.cmake.org/)
- [GLEW](http://glew.sourceforge.net/)
- [SDL2](http://www.libsdl.org/)
- [ASSIMP](http://assimp.sourceforge.net/)
- [BULLET3](http://bulletphysics.org/)

###NOTES for Non-Windows users ###
Engine's code is cross-platform, but due to limited amount of time, project toolchain is done only for Windows (Visual Studio 2015). This might change in future versions. For now, you have to figure it out yourselves.
