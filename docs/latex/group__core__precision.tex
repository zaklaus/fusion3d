Non-\/\+G\+L\+S\+L types that are used to define precision-\/based types. 

The G\+L\+S\+L language allows the user to define the precision of a particular variable. In Open\+G\+L\textquotesingle{}s G\+L\+S\+L, these precision qualifiers have no effect; they are there for compatibility with Open\+G\+L E\+S\textquotesingle{}s precision qualifiers, where they {\itshape do} have an effect.

C++ has no language equivalent to precision qualifiers. So G\+L\+M provides the next-\/best thing\+: a number of typedefs of the \hyperlink{group__core__template}{Template types} that use a particular precision.

None of these types make any guarantees about the actual precision used.
